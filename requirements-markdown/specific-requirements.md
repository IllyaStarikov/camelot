# Specific Requirements

## System Requirements
Our user base will be split across two use cases:
1. The end users, who will be referred to as the user, and
2. The client teams, who will be referred as the devs

### User Requirements
The users will need to be able to communicate with other users across channels. They should be able to send and receive and receive messages. Messages should be sent and received in a logical order.
### Dev Requirements
The devs will require the ability to request a list of channels. The list will contain information regarding the channel names and the users currently in each channel. With a successsful login, they should be able to create to create a unique user with a specific identifier. Users should be deleted upon signing out or error. The devs should be able to request message information, such as message text, senders, requested channel, and timestamps.
