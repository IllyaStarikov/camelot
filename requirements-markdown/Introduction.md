# Introduction
Camelot is JSON-based server written exclusively in [Python 3](https://www.python.org/about/). The purpose of Camelot is to provide IRC-esque chatroom functionality. 

## Purpose
This document is intended to guide development of Camelot. Not only will it provide the requirements (i.e. system requirements, user requirements, and interface requirements), but it will provide a decent outline for what the server entails (i.e. functions, constraints, dependencies, etc.). Understanding the system requirements will give a more clear and concise understanding of the APIs and their purpose.
