\chapter{Description}\label{description}
This section will give the reader an overview of the project, including
why it was conceived, what it will do when complete, and the types of
people we expect will use it. We also list constraints that were faced
during development and assumptions we made about how we would proceed.

The Camelot Server project will create a means of communication between
chat clients, in order to allow end users to communicate with each
other.

\section{Product Perspective}\label{product-perspective}
We have chosen to develop this project in order to create a standard
form of communication between the chat clients that are being developed
to use the server. The developers will use this in order to create an
interface to house the information being transmitted.

\section{Product Functions}\label{product-functions}
The server will have the following capabilities:

\begin{description}
    \item[Create channels] The server will be able to create channels that clients can
        connect to and users can chat in.

    \item[Monitor channels] The server will be able to connect to all channels and see the messages
        that have been transmitted, and the users that are currently connected

    \item[Delete channels] The server will be able to remove channels

    \item[Host clients] Clients will be able to connect to the server and access different
        channels on the server

    \item[Send/Receive messages] The server will be able to send messages to all clients accessing a
        channel, and receive messages from clients on any channel

\end{description}


\section{User Characteristics}\label{user-characteristics}
Most users will be developers who will make clients to interface with
the server. They will be mostly of a more technical background, with
education background involving computer programming. They will be
interfacing with the server in order to create a client for end users to
communicate with each other. They may encounter obstacles with reading
messages if they have no experience with parsing \gls{json}.

\section{General Constraints}\label{general-constraints}
For the constraints of our server, we didn't have any specific
constraints as to what \acrfull{ide} each person used or the platform that they
developed on. The only specific constraints that we have so far is that
the server is going to be developed with \gls{python}3 using \gls{json} for data
transfer and also that each person use \gls{git} for collaborating on the
development of the server. We have not run into any issues with making
our server compatible with other software as of yet.

\section{Assumptions and
Dependencies}\label{assumptions-and-dependencies}
The assumptions made with the development of this project is that each
person that will be working on the server has a working knowledge of
some programming language (most likely \gls{cpp}) and is willing to learn
python. Its also assumed that at least some people working on the server
have some background knowledge as to how to program in python as to help
others within the server group who aren't as familiar with Python.
