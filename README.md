# se-server
Server for software engineering.

## The Server
The server can be accessed via `SSH`, with credentials as follows:

- host: camelotserver.ddns.net
- port (ssh): 2202
- port (server): 9009
- user: cs3100
- **Ask a team member for this**.

To `SSH` into the server on Bash (or a similar Shell), a command like `ssh cs3100@camelotserver.ddns.net -p 2202` will work.
